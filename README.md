Text to Speech Application
***************************************************************
A text-to-speech application with HTML, CSS, and JS is a web-based tool that can convert text into spoken words. The application uses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages to create a user-friendly interface where users can input text and listen to the output.

The application usually consists of three main components: the input field, the conversion engine, and the audio output. The input field allows users to type or paste the text they want to convert into speech. The conversion engine, which is typically powered by a third-party text-to-speech API, takes the input text and generates an audio file. Finally, the audio output component plays the generated audio file for the user to listen to.

HTML is used to create the structure and layout of the application's user interface, while CSS is used to style it and make it visually appealing. JavaScript is used to implement the logic and functionality of the application, such as handling user input and controlling the audio playback.

Overall, a text-to-speech application with HTML, CSS, and JS is a convenient and useful tool for people who need to convert written text into spoken words.
